# Detection of Leukemia Using MATLAB
This is the implementation of the article called "Detection of Leukemia Using MATLAB". I wrote this code for my project on Image Processing lecture.
## Abstract
> Leukemia disease is one of the leading causes of
> death among human. Its cure rate and prognosis depends
> mainly on the early detection and diagnosis of the disease. At
> the moment, identification of blood disorders is through visual
> inspection of microscopic images by examining changes like
> texture, geometry, colour and statistical analysis of images.
> This paper describes a preliminary study of developing a
> detection of leukemia types using microscopic blood sample
> images. Image analyzing is very important role play in the
> diseases of leukemia can be detected and diagnosed at earlier
> stage. Images are used as they are cheap and do not require
> expensive testing and lab equipment. In this paper used
> detection of leukemia cells in the normal blood cells using
> MATLAB.
